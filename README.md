# Unity 2017 Game Optimization - Second Edition
This is the code repository for [Unity 2017 Game Optimization - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/unity-2017-game-optimization-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788392365), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Unity is an awesome game development framework. Through its massive feature-set and ease-of-use, Unity helps put some of the best processing and rendering technology in the hands of hobbyists and professionals alike.

This book shows you how to make your games fly with the recent version of Unity 2017, and demonstrates that high performance does not need to be limited to games with the biggest teams and budgets.

Since nothing turns gamers away from a game faster than a poor user-experience, the book starts by explaining how to use the Unity Profiler to detect problems. You will learn how to use stopwatches, timers and logging methods to diagnose the problem. You will then explore techniques to improve performance through better programming practices.

Moving on, you will then learn about Unity’s built-in batching processes; when they can be used to improve performance, and their limitations. Next, you will import your art assets using minimal space, CPU and memory at runtime, and discover some underused features and approaches for managing asset data. You will also improve graphics, particle system and shader performance with a series of tips and tricks to make the most of GPU parallel processing.

You will then delve into the fundamental layers of the Unity3D engine to discuss some issues that may be difficult to understand without a strong knowledge of its inner-workings. The book also introduces you to the critical performance problems for VR projects and how to tackle them.

By the end of the book, you will have learnt to improve the development workflow by properly organizing assets and ways to instantiate assets as quickly and waste-free as possible via object pooling

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
// Use this for initialization
void Start () {

}

// Update is called once per-frame
void Update () {

}
```

The majority of this book will focus on features and enhancements that apply to Unity 2017. Many of the techniques explored within this book can be applied to Unity 5.x projects and older, but feature lists may appear different. These differences will be highlighted where applicable.
